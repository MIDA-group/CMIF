# CMIF
Fast computation of cross-mutual information function (CMIF) in the frequency domain

---

This aims to be a faithful implementation of fast CMIF [1], in brief, well commented and clean MATLAB code.
See example in the 'help' text for usage instructions.
Code is reasonably fast, if not using too many quantization levels. 
If you find it useful, please cite [1].
