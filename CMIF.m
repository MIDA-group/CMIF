%
% Cross Mutual Information Function for two integer valued 2D images A and B
% Recommended is to quantize the images first, e.g., using imsegkmeans
%
%   Example
%   -------
%
%   % Load images
%   onion   = imread('onion.png');
%   peppers = rgb2gray(imread('peppers.png'));
%   imshowpair(peppers,onion,'montage')
%
%   % Quantize to levels
%   Q_onion = imsegkmeans(onion,6);
%   Q_peppers = imsegkmeans(peppers,6);
%   c = CMIF(Q_peppers,Q_onion);
%   figure, surf(c), shading flat
% 
%   [ypeak, xpeak] = find(c==max(c(:)));
%   % Compute translation from max location in correlation matrix
%   yoffSet = ypeak-size(onion,1);
%   xoffSet = xpeak-size(onion,2);
%   
%   % Display matched area
%   figure
%   hAx  = axes;
%   imshow(peppers,'Parent', hAx);
%   drawrectangle(hAx, 'Position', [xoffSet+1, yoffSet+1, size(onion,2), size(onion,1)]);
%
%
% Note: CMIF uses the same convention as xcorr2, where the second argument is sliding
%  This different from normxcorr2, for which the first argument is sliding.
